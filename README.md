## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm Alejandro Figueroa, a Full-Stack Developer with a unique focus on developing fully autonomous software systems. I'm currently at TalentNow, driving innovation in B2B SaaS. What sets me apart is my ambition to automate not just tasks but the entire software development lifecycle, aiming for systems that can self-improve and adapt. I am building all my systems to be open-source.

## 📈 Goals

- **Short-Term**: Create a suite of automation tools designed to accelerate all aspects of software development.
- **Mid-Term**: 
  - Develop a CLI tool using these automation tools that takes an idea through research, requirements breakdown, and ticket handling.
  - Create another CLI tool that takes tickets as input and autonomously implements, tests, and deploys solutions.
- **Long-Term**: 
  - Merge these systems into a cohesive, self-improving, fully autonomous system for end-to-end software development and continuous autonomous deployment and iteration.
  
  Additional aspirational goals include:
  
  - Pioneering cutting-edge technologies.
  - Launching an autonomous civilization seed system.
  - Mastering the automation of automation.
  - Achieving Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).
  - Develop decentralized systems that make technototalitarianism impossible.
