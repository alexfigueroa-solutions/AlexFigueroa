## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hey there! I'm Alejandro, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in building fully autonomous software systems and tools - both shared CLI tools and libraries, and web application tooling. Currently, I'm working at TalentNow, where I contribute to shaping the future of B2B SaaS. I'm an accelerationist, deeply passionate about decentralizing power through technology and always excited to talk about technototalitarianism and the singularity.

## üöÄ Projects

- [Python-spin-up](https://github.com/cybrvybe/python-spin-up): A CLI tool for streamlining Python project creation.
- [RunDBFast](https://github.com/cybrvybe/rundbfast): Effortlessly spin up databases for rapid prototyping and consistent dev setups.
- [WorkspaceAutomator](https://github.com/cybrvybe/workspace-automator): A tool for autonomous daily setup of your work environment and workspace/monitor setup.
- [CodebasedUtils](https://github.com/cybrvybe/codebased-utils): A shared util library for handling common developer tasks, like copying the simplified, relevant codebase directory tree to the clipboard to paste into LLMs.
- [WindowsPowershellScripts](https://github.com/cybrvybe/windows-powershell-scripts): A shared script library for handling basic, recurrent windows tasks, such as setting up your dev environment on your local, via installations, etc, as well as some docker debugging scripts.

## üìà Goals
- Develop a suite of automation tooling to speed up all software development related activities.
- Use this suite of automation tooling to build a CLI tool, which uses LLMs to extrapolate on a project idea - end-to-end - from idea, to extrapolation, to research, to requirements breakdown, to ticket handling. 
- Use the suite of automation tooling to help me build a CLI tool, which takes tickets as input, and autonomously implements and tests and deploys the solutions to the tickets. 
- Combine the above 2 systems with each other to form a cohesive, recursive, self-improving, fully autonomous system for end-to-end software development - from idea to deployment and continuous/infinite iteration. This is essentially a self-improving system, with the capability to write enterprise-grade software systems fully autonomously; a fully autonomous software forge. 

- Building the most advanced technologies in the world.
- Creating an autonomous civilization seed system for every home on Earth.
- Automation of automation.
- Achieving Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).
