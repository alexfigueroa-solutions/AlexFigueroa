## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm Alejandro Figueroa, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in creating fully autonomous software systems. Currently employed at a small sized startup within a larger parent company structure, I'm on a professional team (~10 people) of software engineers and QA testers, working on a multi-million dollar B2B SaaS platform servicing Fortune 50 companies in multi-tenant talent management and analytics. 

Beyond my day job, my unique contribution to the tech industry lies in my quest to fully automate the entire end-to-end software development lifecycle (from idea to continuous deployment and iteration), with a focus on self-improving and adaptive systems. All of my projects are open-source, adhering to my belief in decentralization and the distribution of access to solutions.

## üìà Goals

- **Short-Term**: Create a suite of automation tools designed to accelerate all aspects of software development.
- **Mid-Term**: 
  - Develop a CLI tool using these automation tools that takes an idea through research, requirements breakdown, and ticket handling.
  - Create another CLI tool that takes tickets as input and autonomously implements, tests, and deploys solutions.
- **Long-Term**: 
  - Merge these systems into a cohesive, self-improving, fully autonomous system for end-to-end software development and continuous autonomous deployment and iteration (from idea to live, constantly iterated product or tool).
  
  Additional aspirational goals include:
  
  - Pioneering cutting-edge technologies.
  - Launching an autonomous civilization seed system.
  - Mastering the automation of automation.
  - Achieving Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).
  - Develop decentralized systems that make technototalitarianism impossible.
  - Innovate in creating compact end-to-end hardware automation systems to make hardware and robotics, fully autonomously.
